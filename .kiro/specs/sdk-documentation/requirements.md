# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SDK Documentation feature aims to provide comprehensive, developer-friendly materials that enable third-party applications to integrate and leverage the AudioCap Core library as a module. The documentation will include conceptual guides, API references, sample projects, and integration recipes, ensuring that developers can embed audio recording and processing capabilities with minimal friction and high confidence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating AudioCap, I want a concise Quick-Start guide, so that I can integrate basic recording functionality within minutes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer visits the documentation landing page THEN the system SHALL present a Quick-Start guide featuring installation, minimal setup code, and expected output.
2. WHEN the Quick-Start sample is copied verbatim THEN the system SHALL compile and run without modification.
3. IF the SDK version is updated THEN the system SHALL update the Quick-Start guide within one release cycle.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an integrator, I want a complete, searchable API reference, so that I can understand all public types, methods, and expected behaviours.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new public symbols are added to the Core module THEN the system SHALL automatically generate API reference pages.
2. WHEN a developer searches the API reference THEN the system SHALL return relevant entries within 200 ms.
3. IF a symbol is deprecated THEN the system SHALL mark it as deprecated with recommended alternatives.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want annotated integration recipes for common scenarios, so that I can quickly adapt the SDK to my application's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation is viewed THEN the system SHALL provide code recipes for mono recording, multichannel recording, and adaptive bitrate streaming.
2. WHEN a recipe is followed AND prerequisites are satisfied THEN the system SHALL compile and run successfully.
3. IF an underlying API used in a recipe changes THEN the system SHALL update the affected recipe within one release cycle.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want versioned documentation, so that developers can reference docs that match the SDK version they are using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new release tag is pushed THEN the system SHALL publish a version-specific set of documentation.
2. WHEN a developer selects a version from the docs UI THEN the system SHALL display content for that version only.
3. IF no docs exist for a historical version THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest the closest available version.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want sample projects and CI-validated code snippets, so that I can trust that the documentation remains correct over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI runs THEN the system SHALL compile and test all sample projects and code snippets.
2. IF a snippet fails to compile THEN the system SHALL fail the CI pipeline and notify maintainers.
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL trigger CI validation of affected snippets.
